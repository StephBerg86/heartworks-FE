This assessment was pretty hard for me. I've had some bugs where I've spend hours on, and then it turned out my whole code was right but I just mixed up some brackets. I've also spend a lot of time with drawing the app on paper and figuring out in my head what the right order was and if things where supposed to happen in the front or backend.

The 'bid' part was the hardest for me. Especially because it was hard to figure out where to start with this and if I had to update the artwork table or the bid table or the user table, or all of them? And I could get inside my action thunk and couldn't figure out why and then I couldn't do the rest off that assignment.
I also spend a lot of time on the likes (hearts). At one point it was working in the frontend but not backend and then the other way arround and then it worked in the component but not in the homepage... really frustrating.

Next time it would be better to take more breaks. Because some bugs where really stupid but costs a lot of time and could be prevented by just taking a fresh look at it. Also next time I want to practise more with doing the frontend and backend at the same time. Because when I practiced I only did Redux or only backend.
